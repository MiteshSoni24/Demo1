#Creating a Online Banking Application in Java with JDBC involves several steps.
Hereâ€™s an outline of what we will do:

1.Set Up the Environment:

    Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
    Install and set up a database, like MySQL.
    Add the JDBC driver to your project.


2.Create Database and Tables:

    Create Database BankingApp.
    Set up three tables: Accountant, Transaction, and Customer.


3.Create the Java Project Structure:

    Organize the project with packages like model, dao, service and Utility.
    src/
    |-- model/
    |   |-- Accountant.java
    |   |-- Customer.java
    |   |-- Transaction.java
    |
    |-- dao/
    |   |-- AccountantDAO.java
    |   |-- CustomerDAO.java
    |   |-- TransactionDAO.java
    |
    |-- service/
    |   |-- AccountantService.java
    |   |-- CustomerService.java
    |   |-- TransactionService.java
    |
    |--Utility/
    |   |--DBUtil
    |
    |-- Main.java

4.Implement the JDBC Code:

  Connect to the database.
  Create DAO (Data Access Object) classes for each table.


5.Create a Simple Interface to Interact with the Database

    Write a simple console-based interface to interact with the database.



~Service classes: This classes serves as the intermediary between the DAO classes and the main application logic, encapsulating the business logic.

~DAO Classes: These classes handle direct interactions with the database for their respective tables. They include methods to add records ,update records , delete records and retrieve all records.

~Model: These classes represent the structure of the data and include fields, constructors, setters, and getters.

~Utility: This is used to establish a connection with the MySQL database.

~Main Class: This class provides a simple console-based user interface to interact with the banking application, allowing the user to perform CRUD operations.
